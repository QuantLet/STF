Input: 'SIGMA- volatility
	RHO- correlation between the spot price and volatility processes
	KAPPA- speed of mean reversion of the volatility process
	N- time endpoint
	delta- time step size
	THETA- long-term mean of the volatility process'

Output: GBM and Heston dynamics

Example: 'User inputs the SFEWienerProcess parameters as sample input spot = 4 mu = .02 kappa = 2 theta = .04 sigma = .3 rho = -.05 days = 100 time = (0:days)/days STATE = [3621423255; 1292471671] randn("state",STATE) no = normrnd(0,1,length(time)-1,2); needed supplied functions are simGBM, simHeston.'
