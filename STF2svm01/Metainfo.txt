Input: 'G- Data Matrix, needs to include labels
	x1- integer, First variable to be drawn on the 2 Dim. plot
	x2- integer, Second variable drawn on the 2 Dim. plot
	y- integer, Indicates the column number where the lables are stored in D
	c- scalar, Capacity constraint
	sig- scalar, prior for RBF kernel'

Output: 'Four 2-DIm Plot of a svm classification. The RBF kernel and hinge loss are used. The triangles represent solvent (y = -1) and circles represent insolvent companies (y = +1). The shaded object represent the support vectors. The colored background corresponds to different score values $f$. The bluer the area, the higher the score (y= +1). Most successful companies (y=-1) are in the red area.'

Example: 'Plots for commands: stf2svm01(G,28,7,3,1,100), stf2svm01(G,28,7,3,1,2),  stf2svm01(G,28,7,3,1,1/2) and stf2svm01(G,28,7,3,200,2)'
