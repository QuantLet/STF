Example: 'Produces these plots: a plot of the ruin probability and capital of an insurance company and plots of the relative error and capital.
          One error plot with:
          blue - err2
          brown - err3
          red - err5
          black - err7
          darkgreen - err8
          One error plot with:
          red - err4
          blue - err6
          magenta - err9
          darkgreen - err10
          brown - err11.'
